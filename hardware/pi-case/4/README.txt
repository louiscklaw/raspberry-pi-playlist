# Summary

Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ case.
Please note: 
* this case is made for wall mounting
* this case is intended to use as steamlink device, so it does not supports gpio, camera outputs and microSD card replacement easily
* No fan supported. Only vent holes.

Things for assembly:
* (Must Have) M2.5 panhead or buttonhead screws ( 8mm or 10mm ). **M3 is NOT OK!**
* (Optional) piece of mesh fabric (60x60mm) and cyanoacrilate glue for vent hole protection
* (Optional) M3-M5 flathead screws for wall mounting.

# Assembly

## Add mesh fabric ( optional )

Print ( on a paper printer ) included PDF without scaling and cut mesh fabric ( note: the lines on the print are MINIMAL, you should add ~3mm field outside when cutting )

**Read instructions for your glue**. Avoid putting in into your skin or eyes or funiture. It can not be removed.

Put Cyanacrilate glue on two contours that stand out from the internal side of top case part. I do it with toothpick
Put mesh fabric over and press with piece of paper.
Add some glue over fabric in the corners and centers of contours 
Wait until dry.

Add Mesh Fabric

## Basic assembly

For assembly you need:
4 x M2.5x8mm screws with pan or button head.
You can use M2.5x10mm screws. This is better, but it is harder to find them.

You CAN NOT use M3 screws as Raspberry Pi holes are 2.75mm diameter: you can damage your board.



## Screw to the wall

For mounting you need:
2 x M3-M5 screws with flat ( countersunk ) head.

After assembly take flathead screws and crew it to the wall through holes for screwdriver.
